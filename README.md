🧠 Facial Emotion Recognition using CNN

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify human emotions (happy or sad) from facial images. It demonstrates key steps in a computer vision pipeline, including data preprocessing, model training, and testing on real images.

⚙️ Tools

Python · TensorFlow/Keras · OpenCV · NumPy

🚀 Highlights

1) Built and trained a custom CNN for emotion recognition
2) Cleaned and preprocessed image datasets
3) Tested model performance on unseen facial images
